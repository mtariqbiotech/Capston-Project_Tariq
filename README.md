## Introduction
This project aims to investigate/analyze risk factors leading to cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the fourth-most common death cause in women worldwide. Particularly, in low-income countries in Africa, South America, and Asia, cervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women. Smoking, heterogeneity in partnership, and use of contraceptives are the risk factors for this type of cancer. Diagnosis is done by a biopsy.
